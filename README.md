I'm a Research Engineer/Data Scientist working for Voltalis, a leading provider of demand response for the french electricity grid. I graduated from both Centrale Lyon (France) and DTU (Denmark) with a focus on both Data Science/AI and Optimization.
I have a strong interest in Programming, Data Science and Engineering problems.

I have have experience applying ML/DL models to the electricity grid and especially to demand response as I have written my master thesis about <i>Deep Reinforcement Learning  for demand side management of building energy consumption</i>. You can find a short paper highlighting the most important results [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3427773.3427862).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deploying demand response on a huge scale
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about CI/CD
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source Python/R projects, especially related to ML/DL and Electricity
